# jira-package

Contains the definition of the Jira primitive Objective Type for interacting with Jira-based Issue resources, along with tests for instances of that type.

Note that this repository for the Jira Objective Type was copied from "jira-resource-driver", in which these package artifacts originally resided.  It was copied so that history for the package would be retained, at the expense of including potentially distracting history for the Jira resource driver that also resided in that repository.  So you'll see in the history for this repository that the resource driver directory and its contents were removed, along with the rename of the objective type package directory.

See [the Jira Issue Objective Type wiki topic](http://wiki.seqos.local/Doc/Packages/SolutionsDev/JiraIssueObjectiveType) for documentation user-level documentation.
